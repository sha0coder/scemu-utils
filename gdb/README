1. rip diffing

first of all make sure with this diffing the banches and paths are ok


scemu execution-path log:
target/release/scemu -f /bin/ls -6 --reg rip | grep rip > /tmp/scemu.log


gdb execution-path log:
gdb /bin/ls
source scemu.py
b _start
r
logrip

(takes time)

python3 diff2.py

...
1110  0x7ffff7feb671 0x7ffff7feb671
1111  0x7ffff7feb673 0x7ffff7feb673
1112  0x7ffff7feb677 0x7ffff7feb677
1113  0x7ffff7feb67b 0x7ffff7feb67b
1114  0x7ffff7feb67d 0x7ffff7feb673


this means that until 1113 all the path is ok

1112 0x7ffff7feb677: cmp   qword ptr [rax],0
1113 0x7ffff7feb67b: jne   short 00007FFFF7FEB673h

Then use the "goto" gdb plugin go to 1112

(gdb) goto 1111
(gdb) x/i $pc


(gdb) x/i $pc
=> 0x7ffff7feb677 <_dl_sysdep_start+71>:	cmp    QWORD PTR [rax],0x0
(gdb) i r rax
rax            0x7fffffffe2d0      140737488347856

--- console ---
=>r rax
	rax: 0x7fffffffe280 140737488347776 (stack)

rax is not ok.

Now is necesasry to do a register diffing

2. reg diffing
